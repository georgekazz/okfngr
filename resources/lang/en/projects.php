The project integrates state-of-the-art capabilities in malware analysis, penetration testing, CTI (cyber threat intelligence), and mitigation of attacks targeting AI systems—especially large language models—while ensuring seamless interoperability with existing SOC infrastructures and third-party tools. Its goal is to empower SOC analysts with practical technologies and shared knowledge that measurably improve operational resilience.',

Threats in cyberspace are global and can impact multiple sectors, sometimes causing damage far beyond their intended targets. As digital systems grow more complex, total prevention of attacks is impossible, but strong, coordinated defences can reduce risks to business continuity. Current security efforts in the EU are often siloed, even as attackers become more coordinated and sophisticated. This requires a new approach to protect critical infrastructure. By monitoring threat actors tactics, techniques, and procedures, along with their motivations and targets, we can improve threat detection and response. INTERSOC (INTERconnected Security Operation Centres) is designed to enhance cybersecurity across the EU. It aims to improve national and EU-level preparedness, enable advanced threat forecasting, strengthen cyber-incident detection and response, and provide training in digital infrastructure security, while upholding privacy and fundamental rights.',
